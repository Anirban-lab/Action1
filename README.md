# Abstract
Human action recognition is an important research area in the field of computer vision having a great number of real-world applications. This work presents soccer player action recognition framework that extracts player silhouette clues, analyzes scene dynamics and interprets player behaviors. Different features have been considered for the player action recognition, some of them concerning the player silhouette analysis, and some others related to the player kinematics. Experiments were carried out on a multi view image sequences of a self created soccer action dataset.
